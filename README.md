Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

**1. Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This will create a new directory called `venv` that will contain the virtual environment.

**2. Activate the virtual environment**

On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On MacOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the code**
Experiments can be run using the `pipeline.ipynb` notebook.
Make sure your kernel points towards the created `venv`.
